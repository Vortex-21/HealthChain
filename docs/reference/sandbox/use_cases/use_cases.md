# Use Cases

Use cases are the core building blocks of sandboxes. They define the API endpoints and the data formats for a given workflow.

We currently support:

- [Clinical Decision Support](./cds.md)
- [Clinical Documentation](./clindoc.md)

More documentation on the pros and cons of each use case will be added soon. For now, you can refer to the source code for more details.
