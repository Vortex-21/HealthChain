# Examples

The best way to learn is by example! Here are some to get you started:

- [Build a CDS sandbox](./cds_sandbox.md): Build a clinical decision support (CDS) system that uses *patient-view* to greet the patient.
- [Build a Clinical Documentation sandbox](./notereader_sandbox.md): Build a NoteReader system which extracts problem, medication, and allergy concepts from free-text clinical notes.
